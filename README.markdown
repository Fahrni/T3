What is T3?
-------------------------

T3 is the first Windows program I ever wrote. It was written in C back in Windows 3.1, it's all 16-bit, but the .EXE still executes in Windows 7 today. You can read a little about it [here](http://rob.crabapples.net/archive/2005_01_09_default.htm#110572333066757403).
